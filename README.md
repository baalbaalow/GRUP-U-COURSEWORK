# GRUP U OOP-COURSEWORK
This project features four Java programs that demonstrate key programming concepts such as OOP, loops, arrays, file handling, and GUI design. The systems include a Grade Calculator, Grade Summary, SK Motors Auction, and a Student Registration application, each designed to perform specific tasks efficiently while showcasing both console-based and graphical Java applications.

DOCUMENTATION OF THE DEVELOPED SYSTEMS
1. Overview
This coursework consists of four Java programs developed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming concepts, control structures, loops, file handling, and graphical user interface design.
The programs developed are:
1.	Grade Calculator System
2.	Grade Summary System
3.	SK Motors Auction System
4.	Student Registration System (Swing GUI Application)
These systems were developed using Java programming language and Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
2. System Requirements
•	Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
•	Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher
•	IDE: NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
•	Hardware: Any computer capable of running Java applications
3. How to Run the Programs
3.1 Console-Based Programs
(Grade Calculator, Grade Summary, SK Motors Auction)
Steps:
1.	Open the project in a Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans).
2.	Run the main class of the program.
3.	Enter the required inputs through the console.
4.	View the results displayed on the console.
3.2 Student Registration System (GUI Application)
Steps:
1.	Open the project in a Java IDE.
2.	Run the StudentRegistrationApp class.
3.	The Student Registration Form window will appear.
4.	Enter student details and click the Submit button.
5.	The system validates the inputs, displays the student data, and saves it to a CSV file.

4. Features of the Systems
4.1 Grade Calculator System
•	Accepts a student’s score out of 100.
•	Determines the grade and remark using if-else-if statements.
•	Displays the score, grade, and remark.
4.2 Grade Summary System
•	Accepts scores for five students using a while loop.
•	Determines grades and remarks for each student.
•	Counts how many students scored each grade.
•	Displays a grade summary.
4.3 SK Motors Auction System
•	Captures vehicle details (registration number and cost).
•	Accepts bid amounts from three bidders.
•	Determines the highest bidder.
•	Captures deposits and expenses.
•	Calculates balance and profit or loss.
•	Displays a detailed auction summary.
4.4 Student Registration System
•	Provides a graphical user interface for student registration.
•	Validates user inputs (name, email, password, date of birth, gender, department).
•	Generates a unique student ID.
•	Displays a formatted student record.
•	Saves records to a file named students.csv.
5. Steps to Use the Systems
5.1 Grade Calculator
1.	Enter the student’s score.
2.	View the calculated grade and remark.
5.2 Grade Summary System
1.	Enter scores for five students.
2.	View individual results.
3.	View the grade summary.
5.3 SK Motors Auction System
1.	Enter vehicle registration number and cost.
2.	Enter bids for three bidders.
3.	Enter expenses and deposits.
4.	View the highest bidder, balance, and profit or loss.
5.4 Student Registration System
1.	Fill in all required fields.
2.	Select date of birth, gender, and department.
3.	Click Submit to validate and save data.
4.	View the output in the display area and CSV file.
6. Brief Explanation of Program Logic
•	Conditional statements (if-else-if) are used to determine grades and remarks.
•	Loops (while and for) are used to process multiple students and bidders.
•	Arrays are used to count grades in the Grade Summary system.
•	Java Swing components are used to design the GUI.
•	Input validation ensures correct data entry.
•	File handling is used to store student records in a CSV file.
7. Tools and Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: Java
•	GUI Framework: Java Swing
•	IDE: NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
•	Concepts Used:
o	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
o	Control Structures (if-else, loops)
o	Arrays
o	File Handling
o	Input Validation
•	Version Control: GitHub
Conclusion
These Java programs showcase practical programming skills, combining logic, data handling, and user-friendly interfaces. From calculating grades to managing auctions and student registrations, the systems run smoothly, validate inputs, and demonstrate how powerful and versatile Java can be for both console and GUI applications.
